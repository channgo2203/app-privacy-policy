## VFRP: Privacy policy

Welcome to the VFRP - VinFast Route Planner app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Hyperlexia in order to help VinFast EV owners finding routes with charging stations.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences like car settings) created by users are stored locally in the device only, and can be simply erased by clearing 
the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, 
please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it.

Yours sincerely,  
Hyperlexia
